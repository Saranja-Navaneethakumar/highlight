  This topic can help you understand Angular: what Angular is, what advantages it provides, and what you might expect as you start to build your applications.

Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with minimal effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.
